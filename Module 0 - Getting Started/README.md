## Create a GitHub account
A GitHub is a code hosting platform providing version control and collaboration. A GitHub account is optional, but highly encouraged.

1. Create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/join)
2. Take a break, you've earned it.

## Notepad++ with GitHub Desktop
If you're new to scripting and want a simple option, or prefer to use Notepad++ instead of a full IDE, this is the recommended option.

1. Download and install [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).
    * In Notepad++ navigate to Plugins > Plugins Admin...
    * Install the Compare and TextFX plugins.
2. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
    * Sign into your GitHub account: File > Options > Accounts
    * Set your preferred editor to Notepad++: .. > Integrations
    * Enable dark mode (because that's what coders do): .. > Appearance

## VisualStudio Code with Git
If you're an advanced scripter and want a full IDE, or already use VS Code, this is the recommended option.

## Using source control with VS Code + Git or GitHub Desktop
