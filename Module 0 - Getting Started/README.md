## Create a GitHub account
A GitHub is a code hosting platform providing version control and collaboration. A GitHub account is optional, but highly encouraged.

1. Create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/join).

## Notepad++ with GitHub Desktop
If you're new to scripting and want a simple option, or prefer to use Notepad++ instead of a full IDE, this is the recommended option.

1. Download and install [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).
    * Install with defaults.
    * In Notepad++ navigate to Plugins > Plugins Admin...
    * Install the Compare and TextFX plugins.
2. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
    * Install with defaults and sign into your GitHub account (if you created one) when finished.
    * Set your preferred editor to Notepad++ and shell to PowerShell: File > Options > Integrations
    * Enable dark mode because that's what coders do: .. > Appearance

## VisualStudio Code with Git
If you're an advanced scripter and want a full IDE, or already use VS Code, this is the recommended option.

1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
    * Install with defaults.
    * Install PowerShell extension: File > Preferences > Extensions
2. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
    * Install with defaults.
